Step 2:
Now the chassis is going to be assambled. Take the slide bars, take the two pylons and attach them to the slide bars. Put the 8 hanger rubber ring gasket inside the 8 hangers, and then place the hangers on the slide bars. Attach the battery mounting board on the pylons and the PAN/TILT platform board on the hangers on the slide bar with the Cross countersunk head srews (M2.5*5,12pcs).

Step 3: 
Now it's time to mount the carbon fiber bottom plate to the four hangers in the middel of the slide bars with the Socket cap screw (M2.5*6,8pcs). Also, attach the Nylon stud (M3*6+6,4pcs) in the Nylon screw (M3*6,4pcs) in four of the hols in the inner circle on the bottom plate.

Step 4:
Attach the Power module to the center of the bottom plate. Then take the fiber carbon top plate and use the Pan head screw (M3*30,16pcs) to attach the arms with the motors by using the 16 nylon straps and the Locknut (M3,16pcs) to lock them in place.

Step 5:
Use the Socket cap screw (M3*8,8pcs) to attach the Landing gear-Vertical pole to the bottom plate. Attach the Landing gear-cross bar to the bottom of the vertical pole. Skrew the propellers on, silver mark on counter-clockwise and black on clockwise rotation.

After these steps are done, the wires to the motors needs to be attached. The red wire goes on the red wire, black on black, and the blur wore from the motors goes on the yellow and black twisted wire which are connected to the power module. Pixhawk 4 is going to be mounted on the top plate and so are the GPS tower and the telemerty radio.
